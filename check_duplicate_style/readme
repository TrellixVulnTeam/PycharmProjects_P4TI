The most significant part of sending email is to pass oauth2 phase.
Microsoft Azure AD (auth server) api does not support backend services to send email for a non-orgnization user (my personal email), so will use the following approach to send email

The app is registered under dynamitez@hotmail.com, app_id and app_secret can be found in the send_email.py source.

Refresh token will expire in 90 days, according to the following docs:
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-configurable-token-lifetimes
    https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/479995b8-dccb-4ad0-82ca-e37f6886b10c/azure-active-directory-refresh-token-expiration?forum=WindowsAzureAD
So i'll refresh the 2 tokens whenever the send_email.py is called

When the refresh token has also expired, please visit the following link and grant access to get a new auth code:
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=6074cf80-a32f-43be-af03-9a1d9fc4e447&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://localhost/sendemail&response_mode=query&scope=offline_access%20user.read%20mail.send&state=12345
The auth code is contained in the reponse: code = UUID, like this one:
    https://localhost/sendemail?code=Mf0082c58-f2ae-b3b2-ab4e-ef2d2bd11c2c&state=12345
Then use the auth code to retrieve the new access token and refresh token:
    POST /common/oauth2/v2.0/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: login.microsoftonline.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    client_id=6074cf80-a32f-43be-af03-9a1d9fc4e447&scope=user.read+mail.send&code=(NEW_ACCESS_CODE)&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fsendemail&grant_type=authorization_code&client_secret=hexyEUN9%3F%5D%25~rfzOJYT5832

Write the new refresh token in the refresh_token file
